# MP: Meal Planner

- Add products to a shared database, including brand, price, and quantity information
- Manage a personal virtual fridge by adding products from the shared database
- Create meals using products from the virtual fridge, with approximate meal cost calculations
- Organize these meals into a weekly meal plan
- Generate a shopping list with an estimated total cost based on the weekly plan

- **Frontend:**
